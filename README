postdoc.

A PostgreSQL-based Electronic Document Management framework for Xojo
"pd- stands for postdoc."



-postdoc is the end result of the following aspects/elements/modules, in order to collectively give rise to its functionality:
  It is a standardized database structure on a PostgreSQL database
  It is a framework allowing Xojo developers to build workflow-based document management applications. Easily.
  It relies heavily on a series of subsystems that are designed to be used independently in other applications.
 
 
-Modules/Subsystems
  pdstorage: A customizable VFS subsystem implementing a mass binary storage mechanism for storing documents (anything that is not metadata)
  pdtransport: A binary data transfer mechanism between a postdoc client and the pdtransport controller, via the PostgreSQL server. 

-The state of postdoc.
  postdoc does not yet exist! It is under heavy development and will continue to be so for the months to come.
  Before any work starts on postdoc itself, the fundamental subsystems need to be functional.
